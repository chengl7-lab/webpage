SegPore is a software to segment the raw Nanopore direct RNA sequence and to estimate various RNA modifications and secondary folding structures.

Oxford Nanopore (ONT) is the third generation sequencing technology. It measures the electric current when a RNA molecule passes through the pore. In principle, different signals are generated for different nucleotides. As we know, there exists different various modifications, e.g. m6A, in the naive RNA molecule. We aim to develop a Gaussain process based model to estimate these modifications from Nanopore data.
