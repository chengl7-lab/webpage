abstract: "The oral microbiota plays vital roles in both oral and systemic
  health, but limited studies have explored the transition of the female oral
  microbiota from preconception to pregnancy along with pronounced hormonal
  fluctuations. To characterize the oral microbiota among women in preconception
  and pregnancy through a prospective study and to explore the associations
  between the oral microbiota and oral hygiene practices. A total of 202
  unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 101 women in both
  preconception and late pregnancy. The oral microbiota was analyzed using 16S
  rRNA gene sequencing. The Ace and phylogenetic diversity (PD) index were
  significantly lower in the third trimester than preconception. The pathogenic
  taxa Prevotella and Atopobium parvulum were significantly higher during late
  pregnancy than preconception. Women with overall better oral. "
