abstract: Alternative polyadenylation increases transcript diversities at the
  3â€™end, regulating biological processes including cell differentiation,
  embryonic development and cancer progression. Here, we present a Bayesian
  method SCAPE, which enables de novo identification and quantification of
  polyadenylation (pA) sites at single-cell level by utilizing insert size
  information. We demonstrated its accuracy and robustness and identified 31 558
  sites from 36 mouse organs, 43.8%(13 807) of which were novel. We illustrated
  that APA isoforms were associated with miRNAs binding and regulated in
  tissue-, cell typeand tumor-specific manners where no difference was found at
  gene expression level, providing an extra layer of information for cell
  clustering. Furthermore, we found genome-wide dynamic changes of APA usage
  during erythropoiesis and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
  differentiation, suggesting APA contributes to the functional flexibility and
  diversity of single cells. We expect SCAPE to aid the analyses of cellular
  dynamics and diversities in health and disease.
